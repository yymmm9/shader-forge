# Toolcraft Figma Implementation

Use this skill after Figma context has been inspected and the task is to build or
update a Toolcraft generated app from that design.

## Process

1. Map Figma sections, components, and visual entities to product output and
   schema controls.
2. Use built-in Toolcraft controls before custom controls.
3. Keep app UI out of `canvasContent`; render product output there only.
4. Preserve the Toolcraft runtime canvas backing.
5. Add acceptance, browser, and performance coverage for every visible product
   entity.

## Toolcraft Rule

Build through `defineToolcraft({ base, modules })` and
`composeToolcraftApp(appSchema, ports)`; the signed route alone renders
`ToolcraftApp`. Do not recreate Toolcraft panels, toolbar, controls, canvas,
layers, or timeline by hand.
