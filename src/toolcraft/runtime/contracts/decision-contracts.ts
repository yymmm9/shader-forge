  "Editable-output apps expose one runtime-owned Infinity canvas mode. Enabling it removes only the finite artboard boundary, clipping, and size controls; disabling it restores the dormant finite size and clipping at the current view without centering. Both transitions preserve canvas offset and zoom, product/image/model world frames, mounted component and renderer identity, and live custom-renderer backing. ToolcraftAppComposition.sceneBoundsProvider declares the product world frame for every exact state in both modes, and runtime gives live custom output and product export the same provider rect. Finite mode presents a centered artboard as the clip and output boundary without changing the canonical product frame; when no provider exists, only finite mode may fall back to that artboard rect. Source pixel dimensions never substitute for explicit image scene geometry. Infinity export outward-rounds and crops to the union of visible product, image, and model contributors; video unions every scheduled state. Hidden layers, suppressed default consumers, preview-only infiniteCanvasContent, and editor-only UI do not contribute. Empty, unavailable, and unsafe oversized Infinity exports return typed visible failures.
